# Git Line Ending Fix

## Problem
Your commit is too large due to line ending changes from 'LF' to 'CRLF'. This happens when files are edited on different operating systems.

## Solution

### Step 1: Configure Git (if Git is installed)

If you have Git installed, run these commands:

```bash
# Configure Git to handle line endings automatically
git config core.autocrlf true

# Normalize line endings in the repository
git add --renormalize .

# Commit the normalized files
git add .
git commit -m "Normalize line endings"
```

### Step 2: If Git is not installed

1. **Install Git for Windows**:
   - Download from: https://git-scm.com/download/win
   - During installation, choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings"

2. **After installation, run the commands from Step 1**

### Step 3: Alternative Manual Fix

If you can't install Git right now, you can:

1. **Use GitHub Desktop** (if available):
   - Install GitHub Desktop
   - Clone your repository
   - Make changes
   - Commit and push

2. **Use VS Code**:
   - Open the repository in VS Code
   - Go to File → Preferences → Settings
   - Search for "eol"
   - Set "Files: Eol" to "\n" (LF)
   - Save all files
   - Commit changes

### Step 4: Prevent Future Issues

The `.gitattributes` file I created will help prevent this issue in the future. It tells Git to:

- Automatically normalize line endings
- Convert to native line endings on checkout
- Handle different file types appropriately

## File Structure

Your project should now have:

```
Dung Lai Lap Trinh - AI Agent/
├── .gitattributes          # Line ending configuration
├── README.md              # Root documentation
└── chatbot/               # Vercel deployment directory
    ├── api/
    ├── public/
    ├── vercel.json
    ├── package.json
    └── ... (other files)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Install Git** (if not already installed)
2. **Run the Git commands** from Step 1
3. **Push to GitHub**
4. **Deploy to Vercel**

## Verification

After fixing, you can verify the line endings are correct by:

```bash
# Check line endings in files
git ls-files --eol

# Should show "text eol=crlf" for Windows files
```

## Common Issues

- **Large commits**: Normalize line endings first
- **Mixed line endings**: Use `.gitattributes` to standardize
- **Git not found**: Install Git for Windows
- **Permission issues**: Run Git as administrator if needed
